I want to use a very un-restricitve licence. But for now, I don't have the experience, which one I can coose. Until I know all consequences of my prefered licence: All rights reserved to Thomas Deniffel. Do not use or copy this project without a written permission by me. Write me, and normally you should get it (but no gurantee).
